        <p>Q1. California, New York, and Texas had the highest number of sales, while North Dakota, West Virginia and Maine had the least number of sales, presumably due to a large/low population respectively.</p>

        <p>Q2. Technology had the highest sales, while office supplies had the lowest. They are over 100,000 sales apart from each other</p>
        <img src="Screenshot_153.png" width="1000" alt="Sales per Month">
        <p>Q2. There are consistent dips in sales in February, and peaks in September and the November/December timeframe. Nov/Dec may be due to christmas gift shopping, and Sept might be for back to school. The dip in February might just be less spending from people in general after the holiday season.</p>
